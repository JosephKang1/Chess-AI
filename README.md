Chess AI Project
This project focuses on the development and testing of my own AI algorithm for playing chess. The algorithm incorporates various techniques including alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, heuristic functions, and more. It was created to compete against other students in a school-wide competition.

Features
Utilizes alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, heuristic functions, and more.
Integrated into the Cadre client based on the Missouri S&T ACM game framework.
Connects to the University's servers for running the AI algorithm.
Planned demo to showcase the AI competing against itself and other opponents.
Status
Due to maintenance on the school's servers, the demo is currently unavailable. However, it will be featured soon to demonstrate the AI's capabilities.

Installation
No installation is required for this project as it runs on the University's servers.

Usage
To use the AI algorithm, connect to the University's servers and run the Cadre client.
