# Chess AI Project

In this project, I developed and tested my own AI algorithm for playing chess. It incorporates techniques such as alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, heuristic functions, and more. The AI algorithm was created to compete against other students in a school-wide competition. The main language used is C++

## Features

- Utilizes alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening, heuristic functions, and more.
- Integrated into the Cadre client based on the Missouri S&T ACM game framework.
- Connects to the University's servers for running the AI algorithm.
- Planned demo to showcase the AI competing against itself and other opponents.

## Status

Due to maintenance on the school's servers, the demo is currently unavailable. However, it will be featured soon to demonstrate the AI's capabilities.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project as it runs on the University's servers.

## Usage

Currnet usage is unavailable, but code is available for viewing.
